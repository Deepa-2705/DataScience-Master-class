# DataScience-Master-class
This repository is dedicated to my solutions of assignments given by PWSKILLS for the course "DATA SCIENCE MASTERS - IMPACT BATCH 1"

## Structure
The Assignments are names in the format : Week-No_month-date > Assignments > Assignment-No.ipynb

In the solutions while solving the assignments I have also gone a bit deep by exploring the web and learning new things which are also a part in some assignments. Also, I have made notes for all the topics and a detailed repository will be made soon in a much more structured format including some pratice codes, notes, assignment questions and solutions.

All the assignments are completed using Jupyter notebook in a way I understood the concepts feel free to go through them as they cover almost the most vital topics involved during the interviews.
